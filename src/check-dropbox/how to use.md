## How to use

Primary grouping for photos is by year created (taken).
There are a few different additional folders that are used in addition for significant events or other requirements.
All of the photos in the additional folders should also be in the year created folder.

When a new photo is added. Check if it has already been added to the year created folder (you can do that by using this script).
If not, then if it is a favourite, add it to the `Favourites` folder. Make sure it is also added to the `All` folder.

Photos are usually added in bulk. For example adding the last few month's photos from a phone. In this case, add them to the year created folder, pick out any favourites and copy them in to the `Favourites` folder. Then copy them all to the `All` folder.

## Rational

- I don't want to lose any photos
- I don't want look at all the photos, I mainly want to look at favourites.
- If I don't keep all of the photos that have been processed for favourites then it's difficult to know, when I find a new batch of photos, if they've already been processed or not.
- Using this script I can easily check if a photo has been processed or not, because all processed photos are stored in the `All` folders of their respective year.
